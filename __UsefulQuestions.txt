// # of objects (Combinatoric)
- Can you calculate contribution of an object to answer?
- Is there any other object that has equivalent # to original object? (ex. # of CC in functional graph == # of Cycle)
- Can you fix object and formulate how does that object contributes?


// DP transitions
- It might be easier to consider transition backward/forward (Try both directions)

// Permuations
- Is it useful to think about inverse?

// Operations
- Any invariant of operation? (ex. Parity, sum of something..)
- Maybe useful to think about inverse operation

// Divide and Conquer
- Can you solve original problem with DnC? Then, for query version try DnC Segment tree
